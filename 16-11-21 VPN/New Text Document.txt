for vpn static, first make 2 instances with the 2 networks created.Create firewall rules for the
2 networks and while doing so give the same ip to both the firewalls.
Dont choose external ip while creating instance.
After creating instance, go to external ip and reserve ip,then go to hybrid connectivity and choose vpn classic.
Create the first vpn with the first network and static ip then in tunneling refer the 2nd static ip. choose route and give the ip
of the desination vpc network. Repeat the process for the next vpn too. ping internal ip in vm ssh shell and its good to go.
